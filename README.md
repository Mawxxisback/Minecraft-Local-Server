Hey! I'm Mawxx, and I wanted to make playing Minecraft with buddies super easy, like just clicking a button.

Setting up a server can be a pain, with all the port stuff, sharing your IP, and dealing with folders. I made this tool to skip all that and just play.

### ✨ What's cool about this?

* **Easy to Use:** No crazy setup. Just one installer takes care of everything.
* **Buttons Inside Minecraft:** I put in buttons right in the Minecraft Multiplayer menu. You can fire up your server, copy the IP, and jump in with friends without leaving the game.
* **Hidden & Safe:** Your server files (like bans and settings) are tucked away in a folder. This keeps your desktop tidy and stops you from deleting anything important.
* **Works for Everyone:** This thing is open-source and doesn't have any personal info. It works for everyone, on any PC.

### 🛠️ How to Use it (Easy Peasy)

1. **Grab** the latest `.exe` for windows from the [Releases](https://github.com/Mawxxisback/Minecraft-Local-Server/releases) section.
2. **Fire up the installer.** It checks for Java and sets everything up.
3. **Open Minecraft** (Fabric 1.21.1).
4. Go to **Multiplayer** and hit the green **START SERVEUR** button.
5. When the console says Done, hit **REJOINDRE** and have a blast!

### 🌍 Open Source Vibes

I think tools like this should be free and open. Check out the code, make your own version, or tweak the buttons if you want.
